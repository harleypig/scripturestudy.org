I want/need an app that will allow me to do the following:

* Allows for arbitrary text; scripture, commentary, reference, random novel.
* Annotate arbitrary chunks of text with text, hyperlink(s) and image(s) in any combination.
* Cross-reference arbitrary chunks of text with other arbitrary chunks of text, both in text I control and text I do not (e.g., remote web page)

I can use Gutenberg for a source of text for most of what I want initially.

Annotation:

* [Annotator.js](http://annotatorjs.org/) ([Repository](https://github.com/openannotation/annotator))
* [Annotorious](https://annotorious.github.io/) ([Repository](https://github.com/annotorious/annotorious))
* [Marginalia](http://webmarginalia.net/) ([Repository](https://code.google.com/p/marginalia/))
