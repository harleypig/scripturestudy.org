I meant to get something a little meatier out today, but I got sidetracked
with various things. Minecraft. Not even once! So I'm going to toss this off
and call it good for this week.

Last week I said that whenever I tried to restart my colorful notes
**something** always happened to stop me.

In the past it has been suggested that this means I'm not supposed to be
marking my scriptures up this way.

Pffft.

If anything, it's the opposite.  The fact that I'm trying to study my
scriptures is probably the cause of the problems.

It's late. I'll do better next week.
