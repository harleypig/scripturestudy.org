Invited to have missionary discussions.

Read BoM:Introduction.

As I read the following paragraph:

Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: “I told the brethren
that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the
keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its
precepts, than by any other book.”

the word 'abiding' stuck out at me.  Of course, need to understand the word
'precepts' as well.

Add definition of abiding and precepts here.

scriptures.byu.edu has links to the Introduction

What does this mean to me?

Don't forget to add this to your online notebook.
